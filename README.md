# Special Topics on Optimal Control and Learning — Fall 2025 (ISYE 8803 VAN)
*Georgia Institute of Technology – Fridays 2-4:45 pm ET*

**Designers:** Andrew Rosemberg & Michael Klamkin  
**Instructor:** Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck

---

## Overview
This student-led course explores modern techniques for controlling — and learning to control — dynamical systems. Topics range from classical optimal control and numerical optimization to reinforcement learning, PDE-constrained optimization (finite-element methods, Neural DiffEq, PINNs, neural operators), and GPU-accelerated workflows.

## Objective
Create an online book at the end using the materials from all lectures.

## Prerequisites
* Solid linear-algebra background  
* Programming experience in Julia, Python, *or* MATLAB  
* Basic ODE familiarity  

## Grading
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Participation | **25 %** |
| In-class Presentations and Chapter | **50 %** |
| Projects (Liaison work & Scribe & Admin & ...) | **25 %** |

**Class material is due one week before the lecture!** No exceptions apart from the first 2 lectures.

**Issues outlining references that will be used for lecture preparation are due at the end of the 3rd week (10/05/2025)!** 
20 minutes of research should give you an initial idea of what you need to read.

🎯🚲 **Guessing Game**

Here’s how the presentation grading works: we already know the lecture content we expect from you. Any deviations will be penalized **exponentially**. Your mission is twofold:  
1. **Check your understanding** — use [discussions](https://github.com/LearningToOptimize/LearningToControlClass/discussions) from previous lectures to ensure you’ve mastered earlier topics. We expect lectures to be extremely linked to each other.
2. **Test your hypotheses** — validate your lecture content by raising and resolving issues, focusing primarily on your *main task issue* (see this example from [class 03](https://github.com/LearningToOptimize/LearningToControlClass/issues/18)).  

All interactions will happen **only through GitHub** — no in-person hints will be given.
