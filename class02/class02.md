# Class 2 â€” 08/29/2025

**Presenter:** Arnaud Deza

**Topic:** Numerical optimization for control (gradient/SQP/QP); ALM vs. interior-point vs. penalty methods

---

## Overview

This class covers the fundamental numerical optimization techniques essential for optimal control problems. We explore gradient-based methods, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), and various approaches to handling constraints including Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM), interior-point methods, and penalty methods.

## Interactive Materials

The class is structured around 1 slide deck and four interactive Jupyter notebooks:

1. **[Part 1a: Root Finding & Backward Euler](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class02/part1_root_finding.html)**
   - Root-finding algorithms for implicit integration
   - Fixed-point iteration vs. Newton's method
   - Application to pendulum dynamics


2. **[Part 1b: Minimization via Newton's Method](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class02/part1_minimization.html)**
   - Unconstrained optimization fundamentals
   - Newton's method implementation
   - Globalization strategies: Hessian matrix and regularization

3. **[Part 2: Equality Constraints](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class02/part2_eq_constraints.html)**
   - Lagrange multiplier theory
   - KKT conditions for equality constraints
   - Quadratic programming implementation

4. **[Part 3: Interior-Point Methods](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class02/part3_ipm.html)**
   - Inequality constraint handling
   - Barrier methods and log-barrier functions
   - Comparison with penalty methods
