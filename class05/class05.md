# Class 5 â€” 09/19/2025

**Presenter:** Guancheng "Ivan" Qiu

**Topic:** Nonlinear trajectory optimization; collocation; implicit integration; differential dynamic programming

---

In this lecture, we will cover examples of nonlinear trajectory optimization, and two methods to solve these problems: transcription (specifically collocation) and differential dynamic programming.

The lecture note is contained in a Pluto notebook (class05/class05.jl). To run it locally, please refer to the [Class 01 documentation](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class01/class01/#Background-Material).
(In *Step 3: Install Pluto and other dependencies*, you should `activate` the environment in the class05 foler.)

The notebook can also be accessed [online](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class05/class05.html)
