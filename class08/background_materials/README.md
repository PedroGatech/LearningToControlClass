# Class 8 Background Material - 10/10/2025

Lecture structure is still under development. Tentative plan:

## Introduction
Brief introduction of my research and background.

## Topic 1: Consensus
"Algorithms that provide rapid agreement and teamwork between all participants"
Great foundational paper:

## Topic 2: ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers)
Great foundational textbook:
https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/admm_distr_stats.pdf

Perhaps introduce with the connection of progressive-hedging (in CEP research) to ADMM?

## Topic 3: Model Predictive Control
Foundational paper (tentative?):
