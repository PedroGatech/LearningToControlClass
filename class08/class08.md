# Class 8 — 10/10/2025

**Presenter:** Kevin Wu

**Topic:** Consensus, ADMM, and Distributed Optimal Control

---

In this lecture, we will cover the concept of *consensus*, *ADMM* (alternating direction method of multipliers), and how these methods can be applied for *distributed optimal control*. 

The lecture note is contained in a Pluto notebook (class08/class08.jl). To run it locally, please refer to the [Class 01 documentation](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class01/class01/#Background-Material).
(In *Step 3: Install Pluto and other dependencies*, you should `activate` the environment in the class08 folder.)

The notebook can also be accessed [online](https://learningtooptimize.github.io/LearningToControlClass/dev/class08/class08.html)
