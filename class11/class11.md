**Presenter:** Michael Klamkin

**Topic:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): formulation & pitfalls

---

This lecture reviews reviews physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a class of deep learning models that incorporate physical laws into their architecture/training. We will discuss the formulation of PINNs, their applications, and common pitfalls to avoid when using them. Since the field is still developing, we structure the chapter as a review of a few select papers with interesting approaches to applying PINNs for problems in control.
