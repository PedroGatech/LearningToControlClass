# Special Topics on Optimal Control and Learning — Fall 2025 (ISYE 8803 VAN)
*Georgia Institute of Technology – Fridays 2 pm ET*

**Designers:** Andrew Rosemberg & Michael Klamkin

**Instructor:** Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck

**2025 cohort**: TBD

---

## Overview
This student-led course explores modern techniques for controlling — and learning to control — dynamical systems. Topics range from classical optimal control and numerical optimization to reinforcement learning, PDE-constrained optimization (finite-element methods, Neural DiffEq, PINNs, neural operators), and GPU-accelerated workflows.

## Prerequisites
* Solid linear-algebra background  
* Programming experience in Julia, Python, *or* MATLAB  
* Basic ODE familiarity
